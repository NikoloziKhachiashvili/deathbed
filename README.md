**deathbed** analyses every tracked source file in a git repository and gives it a **health score** based on eight real, local metrics — no external API calls, no secrets needed.  It then surfaces the files most likely to cause you pain, explains *why* they are dying, and tells you exactly what to do first.

---

## Why?

Every codebase accumulates rot.  Files that nobody owns.  Files too complex to understand.  Files last touched three years ago by someone who left.  Files importing `pickle` in a web handler.  These files never show up in sprint planning, but they quietly cause the most bugs, the slowest onboarding, and the worst incidents.

deathbed makes the invisible visible.

---

## Install

```bash
pip install deathbed
```

Or, to hack on it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NikoloziKhachiashvili/deathbed
cd deathbed
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

---

## Usage

```bash
# Analyse the current git repo
deathbed

# Analyse a different repo
deathbed --path /path/to/repo

# Show only the 20 worst files
deathbed --top 20

# Show only WARNING and CRITICAL files (score < 65)
deathbed --min-score 65

# Output JSON for CI pipelines / scripting
deathbed --format json

# Output a Markdown table (for GitHub comments etc.)
deathbed --format markdown

# Live auto-refreshing dashboard (re-runs every 30s)
deathbed --watch

# Compare health scores between HEAD and HEAD~1
deathbed --diff HEAD~1

# Compare HEAD against any ref
deathbed --diff main

# Export a self-contained HTML report
deathbed --export html

# CI mode — exit 1 if any CRITICAL files are found
deathbed --ci

# Combine flags
deathbed --path ~/projects/myapp --top 10 --format json
deathbed --min-score 70 --ci
```

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--path`, `-p` | `.` | Path to the git repository |
| `--top`, `-t` | `50` | Show only the N worst files (0 = all) |
| `--min-score` | — | Only show files with a health score below this value |
| `--format`, `-f` | `rich` | Output format: `rich`, `json`, or `markdown` |
| `--watch`, `-w` | — | Live auto-refreshing dashboard (30s interval) |
| `--diff REF` | — | Compare health scores between HEAD and REF |
| `--export html` | — | Export a self-contained HTML report to `deathbed-report.html` |
| `--ci` | — | Exit code 1 if any CRITICAL files found (for CI pipelines) |
| `--version`, `-V` | — | Show version and exit |

---

## What it looks like

When you run `deathbed` you get:

## Metrics explained

Each file receives a **composite health score from 0–100** (higher is healthier), built from eight weighted sub-scores:

| # | Metric | Weight | What it measures |
|---|--------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Size** | 13% | Lines of code — penalises files > 300 / 600 / 1000 lines |
| 2 | **Age** | 13% | Days since any commit touched this file — flags abandoned code |
| 3 | **Churn** | 9% | Total number of commits — instability signal |
| 4 | **Complexity** | 18% | Radon cyclomatic complexity average — Python only; N/A otherwise |
| 5 | **Authors** | 12% | Unique git authors — many authors = diffused ownership |
| 6 | **Test coverage** | 9% | Whether a corresponding test file exists anywhere in the repo |
| 7 | **Recent churn** | 16% | Commits in the last 90 days — hotspot detection |
| 8 | **Dead code** | 10% | Unused functions/classes/variables detected by vulture (Python only) |

### Health thresholds

| Score | Status | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 86–100 | ✅ HEALTHY | All good |
| 66–85 | 🌡 FAIR | Minor issues |
| 41–65 | ⚠️ WARNING | Needs attention soon |
| 0–40 | 💀 CRITICAL | Actively dangerous |

### Diagnoses

deathbed automatically picks the most meaningful diagnosis:

| Diagnosis | What it means |
|-----------|--------------|
| `security smell` | File imports dangerous patterns (pickle, eval, exec, os.system, subprocess shell=True) |
| `clone risk` | File is >40% similar to another file — likely a copy-paste |
| `dead code cemetery` | High vulture score — lots of unused symbols |
| `ownership void` | Abandoned for 6+ months and only ever touched by 1 author |
| `complexity graveyard` | Cyclomatic complexity is extremely high |
| `legacy ghost` | Not touched in years — likely orphaned |
| `too many cooks` | Many authors, nobody owns it |
| `churn monster` | Modified constantly — unstable abstraction |
| `growing out of control` | Large and getting larger |
| `nobody's watching this` | Old code with no test coverage |
| `abandoned and complex` | Old *and* hard to understand |
| `healthy` | Nothing to worry about |

Any diagnosis can gain the ` 🔥 heating up` suffix when recent commit activity has spiked 2× over the prior 90-day window.

---

## Trend arrows in the table

The **RECENT** column now shows trend arrows alongside the 90-day commit count:

| Arrow | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| ▲ | Recent churn is 1.5× higher than the prior 90 days — hotspot forming |
| ▼ | Activity has dropped significantly — cooling down |
| ━ | Stable activity or insufficient data |

---

## SECURITY ALERTS panel

If any files contain dangerous import or call patterns, a dedicated red **SECURITY ALERTS** panel appears below the main report, listing every affected file and the specific patterns detected.

---

## Live watch mode

```bash
deathbed --watch
```

Re-scans the repository every 30 seconds, clears the screen, and reprints the full report.  Press **Ctrl+C** to stop.

---

## Diff mode

```bash
deathbed --diff HEAD~1
deathbed --diff main
```

Compares health scores between the current state (HEAD) and any historical git ref.  Shows ▲ improved / ▼ worsened / ━ unchanged with exact deltas.

---

## HTML export

```bash
deathbed --export html
```

Writes a fully self-contained **`deathbed-report.html`** to the current directory.  The report mirrors the terminal UI with:
- Dark red/green colour scheme
- Sortable table (click any column header)
- Score gauges per file
- Most Wanted breakdown
- Quick Wins list
- Security Alerts (if any)

No external dependencies — one file, works offline.

---

## CI integration

```bash
# In .github/workflows/ci.yml or similar:
deathbed --ci --min-score 50
```

Exits with **code 1** if any files are CRITICAL (score ≤ 40), printing a list of offending files to stderr.  Exits 0 otherwise.

---

## JSON output

`--format json` returns a machine-readable object with all new v1.2.0 fields:
